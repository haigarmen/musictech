# Week 1

Study the lessons that are shown for the topics of Week 1 in the [Week-by-Week Plan](week-by-week.md) (Links to an external site.): "Physics of Music", "Basics of Music Theory", and "Sampling Theory".

These topics will be discussed in class on Thursday April 4, so try to do as much as you can of each of the three topics by then. It will most likely be too much for you to get through all of the lessons by then, so focus at first on the things you think you know the least about. Thereafter, you should devote enough time each day to be on pace to complete all of the lessons by class time on Tuesday April 9.

Download the Max 8 application (Links to an external site.) from the Cycling '74 website.

For working with JavaScript, you'll most likely want to use a "smart" text editing program that displays your code with helpful formatting, such as Atom (Links to an external site.) or Sublime Text (Links to an external site.), both of which are available for either MacOS or Windows.

In order to take the quiz in class on Tuesdays, you'll need to bring a laptop or tablet computer with you. If possible, it's recommended to bring a Windows or MacOS laptop with you so that you can do coding work in class.
